In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for 
classification and regression.In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in 
the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:

Pseudocode for KNN:
1.Load the dataset
2.take the new data to be classified
3.Find the distances between that data  and all the other data points in the dataset
4.sort the distances
5.Select top k labels and find the label with maximum frequency
6.Label the new data as the class with maximum frequency
